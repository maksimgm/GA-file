    <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>I am a 2014 UCSB graduate who studied Environmental Studies and History. During my tenure there, I learned how to write papers which communicated ideas effectively in as few words as possible. The most important thing that university taught me was, how to study.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Unfortunately, todays college system does not emphasize technical skills which are useful in the workplace. After graduation, I was fortunate enough to be mentored in basic programming by a senior developer. He taught me a variety of things, such as:</p><br>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix">Unix</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets">CSS</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/maksimgm">Git</a></li>
      </ul><br>
      <p>During this time, I fell in love with programming for several reasons. The creative aspect behind building out your idea block by block was a very appealing concept. Additionally, the aspect of collaboration debunks the common myth of programmers being anti-social. I believe that joining an immersion program will help me take the necessary leap needed to kick start my career as a full-stack developer.</p>
